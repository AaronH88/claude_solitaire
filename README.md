## Development Timeline

### Sequential vs. Parallel Approach

| Phase | Sequential | Parallel | Reduction |
|-------|------------|----------|-----------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | 3 weeks | 1 week | 67% |
| **Phase 2: Core Gameplay** | 4 weeks | 1.5 weeks | 63% |
| **Phase 3: User Experience** | 5 weeks | 2 weeks | 60% |
| **Phase 4: Polish & Features** | 4 weeks | 1 week | 75% |
| **Total** | **16 weeks** | **6 weeks** | **63%** |

### Current Status: Planning Phase Complete

All planning documents have been restructured for multi-agent parallel execution:

- ✅ **Coordination Framework** (`coordination.md`) - Interface contracts and protocols
- ✅ **Phase 1 Plan** (`planPhase1.md`) - 4 parallel streams approach  
- ✅ **Phase 2 Plan** (`planPhase2.md`) - 4 concurrent groups approach
- ✅ **Phase 3 Plan** (`planPhase3.md`) - 4 independent workstreams approach
- ✅ **Phase 4 Plan** (`planPhase4.md`) - 4 parallel feature streams approach
- ✅ **Master Plan** (`plan.md`) - Complete parallel development workflow

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

This project uses an innovative parallel development approach:

### Coordination Framework
- **Interface Contracts**: Shared data structures prevent integration conflicts
- **Mock Services**: Enable independent development across agent teams
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing ensures seamless integration
- **Communication Protocol**: Structured async standups and weekly checkpoints

### Benefits
- **63% Faster Development**: Parallel execution vs sequential approach
- **Higher Quality**: Specialized agents focus on expertise areas  
- **Reduced Risk**: Clear interfaces and testing protocols
- **Better Coordination**: Structured communication and planning
