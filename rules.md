# Klondike Solitaire Rules

## Overview
Klondike is the most popular version of solitaire, played with a standard 52-card deck without Jokers. The goal is to build four foundation piles, one for each suit, in ascending order from Ace to King.

## Setup
1. **Tableau**: Deal 28 cards into 7 columns from left to right:
   - Column 1: 1 card (face up)
   - Column 2: 2 cards (1 face down, 1 face up)
   - Column 3: 3 cards (2 face down, 1 face up)
   - Column 4: 4 cards (3 face down, 1 face up)
   - Column 5: 5 cards (4 face down, 1 face up)
   - Column 6: 6 cards (5 face down, 1 face up)
   - Column 7: 7 cards (6 face down, 1 face up)

2. **Stock**: Remaining 24 cards placed face down in upper left
3. **Waste Pile**: Empty space next to stock for discarded cards
4. **Foundations**: Four empty spaces in upper right for building suit sequences

## Gameplay Rules

### Tableau Building
- Build down in alternating colors (red on black, black on red)
- Only face-up cards can be moved
- Multiple cards can be moved together if they form a valid sequence
- Empty columns can only be filled with Kings (or sequences starting with King)
- When a face-down card is exposed, turn it face up

### Foundation Building
- Build up by suit from Ace to King (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K)
- Only Aces can start a foundation pile
- Cards can be moved from tableau or waste pile to foundations

### Stock and Waste
Common variations for dealing from stock:
- **Turn 3**: Deal 3 cards at once to waste pile, unlimited passes through deck
- **Turn 1**: Deal 1 card at a time to waste pile, unlimited passes through deck
- Only the top card of the waste pile is available for play

### Valid Moves
1. Move cards between tableau columns (following building rules)
2. Move cards from tableau to foundations
3. Move cards from waste pile to tableau or foundations
4. Deal cards from stock to waste pile
5. Move cards from foundations back to tableau (if needed)

## Winning
The game is won when all 52 cards are moved to the four foundation piles in the correct order.

## Probability
- Estimated winning probability: 18% to 43% depending on skill and variant
- "Turn 3" variant is more challenging than "Turn 1"
- Perfect information ("Thoughtful Klondike") has ~82% win rate
