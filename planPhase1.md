# Phase 1: Basic Structure (MVP) - Parallel Execution

## Overview
Create the foundational structure for the Solitaire game with minimal viable functionality using 4 parallel agent streams.

## Goals
- Establish Go backend with static file serving
- Create basic HTML layout and CSS structure
- Implement simple card representation
- Set up initial game state with proper card dealing
- Enable basic click-to-move functionality

## Parallel Agent Streams

**Timeline**: Week 1 (Independent execution)
**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

### Stream B: Frontend Foundation (Agent 3 - UI/UX Specialist)  
**Timeline**: Week 1 (Low dependency)
**Dependencies**: Static file serving from Stream A

### Stream C: Game Logic Core (Agent 2 - javascript-expert-engineer)
**Timeline**: Week 1 (Medium dependency)
**Dependencies**: Basic HTML structure from Stream B

### Stream D: Visual Framework (Agent 3 - UI/UX Specialist)
**Timeline**: Week 1 (Low dependency)  
**Dependencies**: File structure from Stream A

## Tasks by Stream

### Stream A: Backend Infrastructure (Agent 1)
**Agent**: go-expert-developer  
**Focus**: Go server, static file serving, backend foundation  
**Can Execute**: Immediately and independently
- [ ] Initialize Go module (`go mod init solitaire`)
  *Establishes the Go project structure and dependency management system, creating the foundation for package imports and version control that enables the backend to function as a proper Go application.*
- [ ] Create `main.go` with HTTP server
  *Implements the core server functionality that will handle incoming web requests and serve the game interface, providing the essential backend infrastructure that bridges the Go application with web browsers.*
- [ ] Set up static file serving from `/static` directory
  *Configures the server to deliver HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to browsers, enabling the frontend game interface to load and function properly without requiring a complex web framework.*
- [ ] Test server startup and file serving
  *Validates that the backend infrastructure works correctly before building frontend components, ensuring a solid foundation and preventing integration issues later in development.*

### Stream B: Frontend Foundation (Agent 3)
**Agent**: UI/UX Specialist  
**Focus**: HTML structure, CSS layout, responsive framework  
**Dependencies**: Static file serving from Stream A (minimal blocking)
- [ ] Create `static/index.html` with game layout
  *Establishes the visual structure and semantic markup for the Solitaire game interface, providing the HTML foundation that will host all game elements and interactions.*
- [ ] Set up basic CSS grid for game areas:
  - Stock pile (top-left)
  - Waste pile (next to stock)
  - Four foundation piles (top-right)
  - Seven tableau columns (bottom)
  *Creates a responsive and organized layout system that positions game components in their traditional Solitaire locations, ensuring intuitive gameplay and visual clarity.*
- [ ] Create `static/css/main.css` for layout and positioning
  *Defines the overall visual structure and positioning rules for the game interface, establishing consistent spacing, alignment, and responsive behavior across different screen sizes.*
- [ ] Create `static/css/cards.css` for card styling
  *Implements the visual appearance and styling for playing cards, creating recognizable card representations that enhance user experience and game readability.*

### Stream C: Game Logic Core (Agent 2)
**Agent**: javascript-expert-engineer  
**Focus**: Game engine, card system, state management  
**Dependencies**: Basic HTML structure from Stream B
- [ ] `static/js/cards.js` - Card object and deck management
  *Encapsulates all card-related functionality including card creation, deck initialization, and shuffling logic, providing the fundamental data structures that represent the game's playing pieces.*
- [ ] `static/js/game.js` - Game state and initialization
  *Manages the overall game state, tracking card positions and game progress while providing initialization routines that set up a new game with proper card distribution.*
- [ ] `static/js/board.js` - Game board management
  *Handles the visual representation and manipulation of the game board, coordinating between the logical game state and the DOM elements that players interact with.*

### Stream D: Interaction Framework (Agent 4)
**Agent**: javascript-expert-engineer (Interactive Experience)  
**Focus**: UI interactions, event handling, basic animations  
**Dependencies**: Game logic from Stream C and HTML from Stream B

- [ ] `static/js/ui.js` - Basic UI interactions
  *Implements user interface event handling and feedback, translating player clicks and gestures into game actions while providing visual responses to user interactions.*

**Core Interface Tasks (Stream C - Agent 2)**
- [ ] Define card object structure (suit, rank, faceUp)
  *Establishes the fundamental data model for playing cards, creating a standardized representation that supports game logic, validation, and visual rendering throughout the application.*
- [ ] Implement deck creation and shuffling
  *Generates a complete 52-card deck with proper randomization, ensuring fair gameplay and replicating the authentic Solitaire experience with unpredictable card arrangements.*
- [ ] Create initial deal function (7 columns with proper face-up/down)
  *Implements the standard Solitaire dealing pattern that distributes cards across tableau columns with the correct face-up/face-down configuration, establishing the starting game state.*
- [ ] Simple text-based card representation initially
  *Provides a minimal viable card display system using text labels, enabling rapid development and testing of game logic before implementing more sophisticated visual card designs.*

**Basic Interactions (Stream D - Agent 4)**
- [ ] Click event handling for cards
  *Establishes the primary user interaction mechanism that detects and processes player clicks on cards, forming the foundation for all player-initiated game actions.*
- [ ] Basic move validation (can move to foundation/tableau)
  *Implements Solitaire rules validation that ensures only legal moves are allowed, maintaining game integrity and providing immediate feedback on valid player actions.*
- [ ] Simple card movement between piles
  *Creates the core gameplay mechanic that visually and logically transfers cards between different game areas, enabling the fundamental card manipulation that drives Solitaire gameplay.*
- [ ] Stock pile click to reveal cards
  *Implements the stock pile interaction that allows players to cycle through unused cards, providing access to additional playing options when tableau moves are unavailable.*

## Parallel Execution Schedule

### Week 1 Timeline
```
Day 1-2: Stream A (Backend) + Stream B (Frontend) start in parallel
Day 2-3: Stream C (Game Logic) starts after basic HTML structure
Day 3-4: Stream D (Interactions) starts after game interfaces defined
Day 5: Integration and testing of all streams
```

### Dependencies Flow
```
Stream A (Backend) → Provides static serving → Stream B (Frontend)
Stream B (Frontend) → Provides HTML structure → Stream C (Game Logic)  
Stream C (Game Logic) → Provides interfaces → Stream D (Interactions)
All Streams → Integration testing → Phase 1 completion
```

- **CSS Grid**: Use for layout flexibility (Stream B responsibility)
- **Cards**: Represented as divs with text content initially (Stream C → Stream B coordination)
- **Event Delegation**: For card interactions (Stream D responsibility)
- **Game State**: Simple object to track all card positions (Stream C responsibility)
- **No Animations**: Focus on functionality in Phase 1 (animations in Phase 3)
