## Development Workflow

### Local Development Server
Go HTTP server with static file serving:
1. **Development**: `go run main.go`
2. **Build & Run**: `go build && ./solitaire`

Access at: `http://localhost:8080`

### Agent Collaboration Workflow
1. **Daily Standups**: Async progress updates and coordination
2. **Interface Contracts**: Shared definitions prevent integration conflicts
3. **Mock Development**: Agents can work independently using mock services
4. **Weekly Integration**: All agents merge and test together
5. **Quality Gates**: Automated testing ensures integration success

### Multi-Agent Benefits
- **63% Faster Development**: 16 weeks → 6 weeks total timeline
- **Reduced Risk**: Parallel development with clear interface contracts
- **Higher Quality**: Specialized agents focus on their expertise areas
- **Better Coordination**: Structured communication and testing protocols

## Key Features Priority (Parallel Execution)
1. **Phase 1**: Foundation and basic functionality (all agents)
2. **Phase 2**: Core gameplay logic (focused on game rules)
3. **Phase 3**: User experience polish (independent workstreams)
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features (maximum parallelization)

## Testing Strategy (Multi-Agent)
- **Stream-Specific Testing**: Each agent tests their components
- **Integration Testing**: Weekly cross-agent compatibility validation
- **Interface Contract Testing**: Automated validation of shared interfaces
- **Performance Testing**: Cross-stream performance impact analysis
- **End-to-End Testing**: Full system validation with all components
